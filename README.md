    Thank you for your interest in this small project!

    I am Guillermo and this is a little test that I did when I was starting 
    to learn both JS and React
    
    Information about the code:
        -You can find the logic of the conjugator in '/src/logic/verbConjugator'.
        -Actually, this code have not all the japanese congujations, but you 
         implement new models of conjugations following the previous 
         conjugations.
        -All the page was styled using Bootstrap, and I also used react-bootstrap
         build the formulary.
